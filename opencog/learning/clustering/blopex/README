BLOPEX -- Block Locally Optimal Preconditioned Eigenvalue Xolvers
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains a slightly cleaned-up copy of BLOPEX.
The original blopex project site is at:

   https://code.google.com/p/blopex/

and the original code can be found at:

   http://blopex.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ blopex-read-only

The cleanups here are mostly to simplify the build system, and thus
make it easier to use blopex within the OpenCog code base. 

The copying was done because blopex is not a package that can currently
be found in Ubuntu or RedHat, and thus would be a challenge for users to
install.

What is BLOPEX?
---------------
Block Locally Optimal Preconditioned Eigenvalue Xolvers (BLOPEX) is a
package, written in C and MATLAB/OCTAVE, that includes an eigensolver
implemented with the Locally Optimal Block Preconditioned Conjugate
Gradient Method (LOBPCG). Its main features are: a matrix-free iterative
method for computing several extreme eigenpairs of symmetric positive
generalized eigenproblems; a user-defined symmetric positive
preconditioner; robustness with respect to random initial
approximations, variable preconditioners, and ill-conditioning of the
stiffness matrix; and apparently optimal convergence speed.
