                   Example blopex program
                   ----------------------

The code in this directory demonstrates how to use blopex. Its called
"serial" because it does not implement a parallel (MPI) example.  It
demos only the real (not complex) solver.

The main interface to the solver is given in pcg_multi.h.  This file
defines a bunch of matrix and vector routines that the solver will
call. They are defined here, rather than by the solver, because this
allows the blopex user to defer any/all calcuations until absolutely
needed, as well as manage memory access patterns.  That makes the
interface complicated; its owrth it for the speed.

The demo here calls lobpcg_solve_double with a 40x40 diagonal matrix
(double precision) with values of 1 thru 40 on the diagonal.  

It solves for 5 eigenvalues, initial eigenvectors are random, tolerance
1e-6 and max iterations 100. 

The executable is "serial_driver".  Run it from the build directory.
