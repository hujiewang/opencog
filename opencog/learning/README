                    -----------------------

This directory currently contains three subdirectories:

-- moses -- contains the code for the "meta-optimizing semantic
   evolutionary search" algorithm, used in several places inside
   opencog.  MOSES performs regression, aka "supervised learning",
   by learning a combo program that models an output value, given a 
   set of inputs.  See the opencog wiki for more information and
   documentation.

-- feature selection -- contains code to find the most important
   features in a regression problem.  A "feature" is simply one column
   in an input table; a feature is considered to be important when it
   is strongly correlated with the output column.   The goal of feature
   selection is to trim down the set of features to a more managable
   size, so as to improve learning performance.  (Moses works fine with 
   up to 150-200 features; feature-selection should be used when datasets
   are larger than this).

-- dimensionalembedding -- implements a method of dimensional embedding
   of the atomspace using the Harel-Koren algorithm
