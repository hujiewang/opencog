                        Assorted Scheme Scripts
                        -----------------------

Assorted generic scripts related to NLP processing. These carry out
common functions, such as sending off raw text to a parser for parsing,
getting all of the words in that parse, and their parts-of-speech,
lemma forms, the RelEx relations they participate in, etc.


OpenCog scripts
---------------
The following scripts are meant to run within the OpenCog scheme
interpreter (as they manipulate OpenCog atoms directly). They can be
manually loaded with the "load-nlp.sh" shell script, although they
normally would be automatically loaded with the opencog.conf file.

 * nlp-utils: Some mini nlp-related utilities, mostly for pointer
   chasing nlp-specific structures, e.g. getting all the parses of
   a sentence, or getting all of the word instances in a parse, and
   so on. Also:

   + delete-sentence

 * processing-utils.scm: Utilities pertaining to NLP pipeline processing.
   Defines an anchor node where newly parsed sentences can be found.
   Defines utility to send plain-text to a RelEx server to get that
   text parsed, and attaches the new parses to the anchor.

 * parse-rank.scm: Tweak link-grammar parse-ranking scores, based
   on the mutual information contained in word pairs. (Not currently
   used)

 * disjunct-list.scm: Build lists of link-grammar disjuncts. A link-
   grammar disjunct is a list of connectors that are used to connect
   a word to the other words in a sentence.

 * relex-to-logic.scm: Helper-functions and rule-functions for mapping
   mapping RelEx output into a style of OpenCog representation that is
   better suited for automated reasoning by PLN and other tools. Details
   on how to use this relex-to-logic pipeline can be found at
