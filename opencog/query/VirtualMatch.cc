/**
 * Ground (solve) a pattern; perform unification. That is, find one
 * or more groundings for the variables occuring in a collection of
 * clauses (a hypergraph). The hypergraph can be thought of as a
 * a 'predicate' which becomes 'true' when a grounding exists.
 *
 * The predicate is defined in terms of two hypergraphs: one is a
 * hypergraph defining a pattern to be grounded, and the other is a
 * list of bound variables in the first.
 *
 * The bound variables are, by convention, VariableNodes.  (The code in
 * the pattern match engine doesn't care whether the variable nodes are
 * actually of type VariableNode, and so can work with variables that
 * are any kind of node. However, the default callbacks do check for
 * this type. Thus, the restriction, by convention, that the variables
 * must be of type VariableNode.)  The list of bound variables is then
 * assumed to be listed using the ListLink type. So, for example:
 *
 *    ListLink
 *        VariableNode "variable 1"
 *        VariableNode "another variable"
 *
 * The predicate hypergraph is assumed to be a list of "clauses", where
 * each "clause" should be thought of as the tree defined by the outging
 * sets in it.  The below assumes that the list of clauses is specified
 * by means of an AndLink, so, for example:
 *
 *     AndLink
 *        SomeLink ....
 *        SomeOtherLink ...
 *
 * The clauses are assumed to be connected by variables, i.e. each
 * clause has a variable that also appears in some other clause.  Even
 * more strongly, it is assumed that there is just one connected
 * component; the code below throws an error if there is more than one
 * connected component.  The reason for this is to avoid unintended
 * combinatoric explosions: the grounding of any one (connected)
 * component is completely independent of the grounding of any other
 * component.  So, if there are two components, and one has N groundings
 * and the other has M groundings, then the two together trivially have
 * MxN groundings. Its worse if there are 4, 4... components. Rather
 * than stupidly reporting a result MxNx... times, we just throw an
 * error, and let the user decide what to do.
 *
 * The grounding proceeds by requiring each clause to match some part
 * of the atomspace (i.e. of the universe of hypergraphs stored in the
 * atomspace). When a solution is found, PatternMatchCallback::solution
 * method is called, and it is passed two maps: one mapping the bound
 * variables to their groundings, and the other mapping the pattern
 * clauses to their corresponding grounded clauses.
 *
 * Note: the pattern matcher itself doesn't use the atomspace, or care
 * if the groundings live in the atomspace; it can search anything.
 * However, the default callbacks do use the atomspace to find an
 * initial starting point for the search, and thus the search defacto
 * happens on the atomspace.  This restriction can be lifted by tweaking
 * the callback that initially launches the search.
 *
 * At this time, the list of clauses is understood to be a single
 * disjunct; that is, all of the clauses must be simultaneously
 * satisfied.  A future extension could allow the use of MatchOrLinks
 * to support multiple exclusive disjuncts. See the README for more info.
