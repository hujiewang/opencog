 * Remove constant clauses from the list of clauses.

 * Make sure that every clause contains at least one variable;
 * if not, remove the clause from the list of clauses.
 *
 * The core idea is that pattern matching against a constant expression
 * "doesn't make sense" -- the constant expression will always match to
 * itself and is thus "trivial".  In principle, the programmer should
 * never include constants in the list of clauses ... but, due to
 * programmer error, this can happen, and will lead to failures during
 * pattern matching. Thus, the routine below can be used to validate
 * the input.
 *
 * Returns true if the list of clauses was modified, else returns false.

/**
 * Given an input set of clauses, partition this set into its
 * connected components, returning that set. The connected
 * components are added to the set "components".
 *
 * Two clauses are "connected" if they both contain a common
 * variable. A connected component is the set of clauses that are
 * all connected.
 *
 * This method serves two different purposes.  First, if the
 * pattern does not contain any "virtual" links, then the pattern
 * matcher works correctly only if there is one single, connected
 * component (this is by design, since we don't want to deal with
 * the combinatorics).  If the pattern does contain "virtual" links,
 * then the largest connected component should be grounded first,
 * before the grounding of the virtual links is attempted.
 *
 * A side effect of the algorithm is that it sorts the clauses into
 * connected order. That is, given the vector of connected clauses,
 * each element in the vector is connected to some clause that came
 * before (in the vector).  This is handy, because users do not always
 * specify clauses in such an order, and traversal and matching is just
 * a bit faster when pursued in order.
