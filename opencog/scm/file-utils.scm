 exec-scm-from-port port   Execute scheme code read from port

 execute that scheme data.

	; guile, and the default r6rs transcoder is UTF8 and so everyone
	; is happy, these days.  Note: in the good-old bad days, we used
	; ice-9 rw read-string!/partial for this, which went buggy, and
	; started mangling at some point.

 exec-scm-from-cmd cmd-string   Run scheme returend by shell command

 Load data generated by the system command cmd-string. The command

 routine will read and execute that scheme data.

 Example:
 (exec-scm-from-cmd \"cat /tmp/some-file.scm\")
